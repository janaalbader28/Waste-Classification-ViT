## Waste Classification Model using Vision Transformer (ViT)

This project aims to classify waste materials using a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The dataset used for this project is the **Garbage Classification Dataset**, which contains images of different types of garbage. The goal is to develop a deep learning model capable of accurately categorizing these images into distinct categories of waste.

The model architecture is based on **Vision Transformer (ViT)**, which is a state-of-the-art transformer model designed for image classification tasks.
